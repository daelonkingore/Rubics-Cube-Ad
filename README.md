# Rubics-Cube-Ad
This was the final project for a computer graphics class senior year of college. It uses opengl and glut to create a 3D rubrics cube that can be rotated using right click menu options. I was the team leader for the project on a team of 5. The design, menu options, and rotation abilities were created by me, Daelon Kingore.
